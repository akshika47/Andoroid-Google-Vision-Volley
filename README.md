# Object Recognition using Google Vision API on Android
Google Vision API on Android with Volley Library for HTTP Requests

This is a prototype app which was built in 24 hours hackathon(Oxfordhack).

# How to use this code

1. Go ahead and Fork the repo
2. Clone the repo
3. Import the code using Android Studio
4. Resolve the dependency issues
5. Replace the Google vision api details in the Main Activity class
6. Setup a server to consume the HTTP requests (I used Lambda for this, but I have not shown any code segmentes for the server side in this repo)
